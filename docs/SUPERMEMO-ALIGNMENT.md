# SuperMemo workflow alignment

Incremental Reading is inspired by [SuperMemo's incremental reading](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading) workflow and by bjsi's [Incremental Writing plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing). It is an independent implementation for Obsidian, not a port of SuperMemo and not affiliated with or endorsed by either project.

## Summary

The plugin is aligned with SuperMemo at the workflow level:

1. Bring sources into a managed reading collection.
2. Revisit many sources in small, prioritized portions.
3. Preserve a read point between visits.
4. Extract the important parts while retaining their source relationship.
5. Turn selected knowledge into cloze or question-and-answer cards.
6. Review topics and cards over time while managing inevitable overload.

SuperMemo describes incremental reading as importing electronic articles, reading them in small portions, extracting important fragments, converting those fragments into questions and answers, and reviewing them with spaced repetition. Incremental Reading supports the same progression using Markdown notes and Obsidian links.

## Feature comparison

| SuperMemo concept | Incremental Reading equivalent | Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Imported articles and topics | Source notes, clipping import, PDF/EPUB paths, images, and YouTube source notes | Strong |
| Reading many sources in small portions | Priority-aware topic queue, `Next element`, postponement, and manual scheduling | Strong |
| Read points | Markdown read-point markers plus PDF page and media timestamp progress | Strong |
| Extracts linked to their source | Extract notes with `parent` and `source` links | Strong |
| Topics and items | Sources/extracts are reading topics; flashcards are Spaced Repetition items | Strong, split across two plugins |
| Cloze and question-answer generation | Basic, bidirectional, cloze, image, and image-occlusion cards | Strong |
| A-Factor topic scheduling | Progress-aware A-Factor intervals for sources and extracts | Similar, not algorithm-identical |
| Prioritization | Numeric priority, boost/set-priority commands, and urgency-based queue ordering | Strong |
| Knowledge tree and categories | Editable source/extract hierarchy and category notes | Strong |
| Subset review | Filtered subset review by folder, tag, type, or priority | Strong |
| Auto-postpone and overload management | Postpone, subtree postponement, and Mercy spreading of overdue topics | Partial |
| Article decomposition | Extracts, split-on-heading, and split-book commands | Strong |
| Source references | Obsidian links and source/parent frontmatter retained through extraction and card creation | Similar |
| Incremental video and images | Timestamped video sources, image extracts, image cards, and image occlusion | Partial |
| One unified learning process | Separate reading-topic queue and Spaced Repetition card queue | Intentional difference |

## Intentional differences

### Card scheduling and review

SuperMemo presents topics and memory items through one learning system. Incremental Reading schedules only reading topics. It writes cards in native [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) Markdown and opens that plugin's review interface for card study. This keeps cards compatible with a maintained Obsidian ecosystem instead of duplicating a second flashcard scheduler.

As a result, `Next element` advances through reading sources and extracts, while `Review cards` opens Spaced Repetition's UI. The queues are related by source links but are not automatically interleaved into one session.

### Scheduling algorithms

The topic scheduler is inspired by SuperMemo's A-Factor-based topic repetition, but it does not claim to reproduce any SuperMemo algorithm. It combines an A-Factor with priority, progress, read-point changes, postponement, and configurable queue rules. Card intervals are entirely owned by Spaced Repetition.

### Overload tools

SuperMemo documents auto-sort, auto-postpone, and priority-queue mechanisms for large overloaded collections. Incremental Reading provides explicit priority controls, filtered subset review, bulk postponement, and the `Mercy` command for distributing overdue topics. These serve the same practical goal but are not exact equivalents of SuperMemo's automatic behavior.

### Incremental writing

The [Incremental Writing plugin](https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing) inspired the use of prioritized queues, note/block review, manual scheduling, and A-Factor-style intervals in Obsidian. Incremental Reading applies those ideas primarily to reading, extraction, and knowledge capture. It does not replace Incremental Writing's dedicated workflow for repeatedly revising drafts and blocks.

## Design target

The target is functional kinship with the core SuperMemo incremental-reading loop while preserving Obsidian-native files and links:

- keep source material inspectable as ordinary Markdown;
- make partial progress and provenance durable;
- let priority decide what deserves attention;
- support decomposition from source to extract to card;
- provide practical tools when the queue becomes overloaded;
- delegate memory-item review to Spaced Repetition's UI and scheduler.

Features that depend on SuperMemo's proprietary application, data model, or algorithms are outside the compatibility claim.
